Dear GitHub,

Before 2007, the way to participate in Open Source was fragmented. Each project
had their own workflow, patches circulated in emails, issues were reported in
a myriad ways, and if anyone wanted to contribute they had to figure out every
project's rules.

Then, a handful of guys took the challenge to build an awesome platform and as
a consequence of their hard work, their platform _earned_ its hegemony.

Nowadays doing Open Source is infinitely easier thanks to you, GitHub. You've
provided the tools and the social conventions to make those days a thing of the
past. Your impact in the Open Source movement is unprecedented.

We want to express our gratitude for all you've done and do for Open Source.

GitHub, thank you very much.

Signed,
